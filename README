NCurses Owner Tree
==================

This application is basically a copy of ncdu app but written in Common Lisp and
in addition to showing size it also shows size split by owner.

It had much less features than original ncdu: no ability to delete files/folders
(hence no ability to refresh data), also instead of using arrow trees for
navigation it uses keys 'jk' for moving up/down and 'io' for moving in folder
and out of folder (this is due to impossibility to assign key bindings to
arrows and Enter).
